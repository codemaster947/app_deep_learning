    "\n",
    "[Embedding Layers](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Embedding.html) are a handy feature of PyTorch that allows the program to automatically insert additional information into the data flow of your neural network. An embedding layer would automatically allow you to insert vectors in the place of word indexes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers often use embedding layers with Natural Language Processing (NLP); however, you can use these layers when you wish to insert a lengthier vector in an index value place. In some ways, you can think of an embedding layer as dimension expansion. However, the hope is that these additional dimensions provide more information to the model and provide a better score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Embedding Layer Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* **num_embeddings** = How large is the vocabulary?  How many categories are you encoding? This parameter is the number of items in your \"lookup table.\"\n",
    "* **embedding_dim** = How many numbers in the vector you wish to return. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we create a neural network with a vocabulary size of 10, which will reduce those values between 0-9 to 4 number vectors. This neural network does nothing more than passing the embedding on to the output. But it does let us see what the embedding is doing. Each feature vector coming in will have two such features."
