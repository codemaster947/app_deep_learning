    "There are many different methods to encode data over time to a neural network. In this chapter, we will examine time series encoding and recurrent networks, two topics that are logical to put together because they are both methods for dealing with data that spans over time. Time series encoding deals with representing events that occur over time to a neural network. This encoding is necessary because a feedforward neural network will always produce the same output vector for a given input vector. Recurrent neural networks do not require encoding time series data because they can automatically handle data that occur over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variation in temperature during the week is an example of time-series data. For instance, if we know that today’s temperature is 25 degrees Fahrenheit and tomorrow’s temperature is 27 degrees, the recurrent neural networks and time series encoding provide another option to predict the correct temperature for the week. Conversely, a traditional feedforward neural network will always respond with the same output for a given input. If we train a feedforward neural network to predict tomorrow’s temperature, it should return a value of 27 for 25. It will always output 27 when given 25 might hinder its predictions. Surely the temperature of 27 will not always follow 25. It would be better for the neural network to consider the temperatures for days before the prediction. Perhaps the temperature over the last week might allow us to predict tomorrow’s temperature. Therefore, recurrent neural networks and time series encoding represent two different approaches to representing data over time to a neural network.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we trained neural networks with input ($x$) and expected output ($y$). $X$ was a matrix, the rows were training examples, and the columns were values to be predicted. The $x$ value will now contain sequences of data. The definition of the $y$ value will stay the same.\n",

    "Previously, we might take as input a single stock price to predict if we should buy (1), sell (-1), or hold (0). The following code illustrates this encoding."
