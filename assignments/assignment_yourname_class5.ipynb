The same steps apply to either CoLab or a local install.  For CoLab, you must repeat these steps each time the system restarts your virtual environment.  You must perform these steps only once for your virtual Python environment for a local install.  If you are installing locally, make sure to install to the same virtual environment you created for this course.  The following commands install YOLO directly from its GitHub repository."
